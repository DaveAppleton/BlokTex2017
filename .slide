* Quick Intro / commericial break

.image HG.png

- HelloGold is platform to allow the average Malaysian to buy, store and sell investment grade gold at close to international spot prices as a means of diversifying their savings portfolio.
- Is it a SCAM ?
Founded by former CEO of World Gold Council
CTO is former VP of Bangkok Bank 
Partnering with AEON Credit
Fully allocated gold vaulted in fully insured vault in Singapore



* Personal philosophy w.r.t. blockchain

EVERY COMPETENT SOFTWARE ARCHITECT SHOULD INCLUDE BLOCKCHAIN IN THEIR TOOLKIT

* What I AM going to cover
- programming smart contracts
- some tools to help you get started
- talking to contracts from a wallet
- arbitary subjective comments about the state of systems today and where I think they should go

* What I am NOT going to cover
- How to call those contracts from your browser or from a server
- How to build a business using smart contracts
- How to buy and sell virtual currencies

* Getting Started

A smart contract is a program, just like any other with inputs, storage and outputs just on the blockchain.

The smart contract ensures that
- given an initial starting condition
*and*
- given a specific instruction with a particular set of data
*then*
- you will get a specific result

* INPUTS

_Inputs_ come from transactions or calls.

- *Transactions*
make changes to the storage (and cost Ether)
can only return results by _events_

- *Calls*		
query the state of the storage or the results of a calculation
get an immediate response
cannot change the state of the storage


* The language of ethereum smart contracts

- Ethereum EVM is a bytecode interpreter. 
Enables a variety of compilers to be developed to address different user bases.

* Main Languages

- Solidity
Javascript like language. Probably the most popular smart contract language

- Serpent
Python derivative currently losing ground to....

- Viper
A new python derivative that is being actively promoted.

- LLL (Low Level Language)
Not quite assembly language but....

- Assembler
Down to the (almost) bare metal

* Smart Contract 101  (demo in remix)

.code code1.sol
	
- Security issue
Anybody can change the rate !!!

* Smart Contract 101 (demo in ethereum studio)

.code ./code2.sol
	
- Security issue solved 
Only the owner of the contract can change the rate !!!

* Smart Contract 101  (demo in ethereum studio)

.code ./code3.sol

- *WARNING* I can store ANY NAME I LIKE... 
 ...but only in a location that matches an address I control.

* Smart Contract 101 (demo in Parity / Kovan)
.code ./code4.sol
